# Javascript
Below is a suggested JavaScript syllabus for web design:

### Introduction to JavaScript

Basics of JavaScript
JavaScript syntax and structure
Working with variables, data types, and operators
Control structures (if statements, loops)

Write a function that takes a string as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word.

Certainly! Here's a list of JavaScript exercises you can try:

1. Calculate the area of a rectangle. (Similar to the previous exercise)

2. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. Prompt the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.

3. Calculate the factorial of a number. Prompt the user to enter a number and calculate its factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number).

4. Generate a random number. Use `Math.random()` to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and display it to the user.

5. Check if a number is even or odd. Prompt the user to enter a number and display whether it is even or odd.

6. Calculate the sum of multiples. Prompt the user to enter two numbers: a limit and a multiple. Calculate the sum of all multiples of the given number up to the limit.

7. Reverse a string. Prompt the user to enter a string and display the reverse of the input string.

8. Find the largest element in an array. Create an array of numbers and find the largest element in the array.

9. Calculate the average of an array. Create an array of numbers and calculate the average of all the elements in the array.

10. Check if a string is a palindrome. Prompt the user to enter a string and check if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Feel free to choose any exercise from the list or try them all. They cover a range of JavaScript concepts and will help you practice your skills. Enjoy coding!
